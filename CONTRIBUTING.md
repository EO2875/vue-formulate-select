# Issues

I, EO2875, will accept almost any pull request that you open. 
However, I will not actively fix issues unless. 
vue-formulate-select is working for m . 

Maintenance of this repo will be up to the community. 
I'll check the repo every once in a while to accept pull requests. 

If someone more committed and motivated than me asks for it,
I can add them as collaborators in GitHub and NPM 
or even transfer repo ownership.
